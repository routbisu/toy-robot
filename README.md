## Improvements needed

In the interest of time, there a few things that I avoided for the test, which I would do in a production environment:

- Use of TypeScript for better type safely and for catching bugs early.
- Use of styled components for better CSS class names.
- Write snapshot tests using Enzyme.
- Theme support.
- Create better form controls like text inputs, buttons, select etc.
